        <h3>Info</h3>
        <p>I am currently a CSUSB undergraduate student studying Computer Science in conjunction with Computer Administration. I decided to enroll in the Instructional Technology Program at CSUSB because I believe it will help me gain some new skills. My goal is to learn about new ideas and technologies 
                 and how I can educate others about learning strategies. I want to be able to reach an understanding about Instructional Technology and be able to integrate it into my education. I feel like I will strengthen my technology skills greatly through this program and I will become confident about using technology learning environments.</li></p>
